# TypeScript PR Review Guidelines

## Introduction
Welcome to the TypeScript PR review process! To ensure code quality and maintainability, please follow these guidelines when submitting a pull request.

## Code Style
1. **Formatting**: Use consistent formatting throughout the codebase. You can use tools like Prettier to automate this process.
2. **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Follow TypeScript naming conventions. Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.

## TypeScript Best Practices
1. **Type Annotations**: Always add type annotations to variables, function parameters, and return types.
2. **Strict Mode**: Enable TypeScript strict mode in your `tsconfig.json`.
3. **Avoid Any Type**: Minimize the use of the `any` type. Provide explicit types whenever possible.
4. **Null and Undefined**: Use the `strictNullChecks` option and avoid using `null` and `undefined` unless necessary.

## Documentation
1. **JSDoc Comments**: Add JSDoc comments to describe functions, classes, and significant blocks of code.
2. **README Updates**: If your changes introduce new features or modify existing ones, update the project's README with relevant information.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Include unit tests for your changes. Ensure that existing tests pass.
2. **Integration Tests**: If applicable, add integration tests to cover the integration of your changes with other parts of the system.

## Code Review Process
1. **Small, Atomic Commits**: Keep your commits small and focused on a single task or feature.
2. **Clear Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
3. **Address Comments Promptly**: Respond to comments from reviewers promptly and make necessary changes.
4. **Rebase Before Merge**: Keep your feature branch up to date and rebase it on the latest main branch before merging.

## Security
1. **Avoid Vulnerabilities**: Regularly check for and update dependencies to avoid known security vulnerabilities.
